Introduction
Smoking is considered as a big reason of lung cancer,and it also causes a lot of other health problems.So an effective way of quitting smoking is necessary for most of people who are addicted to tobacco and try to stay away from it.But,as we know,human behavior is always hard to change especially when it is associated with addictive chemicals like nicotine.However we are not trying to make something that could physically help people quit smoking but rather a way to help people remember and aware of how much the tobacco has harmed their health.There are already lots of smoking detection approaches .In this report we will compare our approach with another project made by Artem Dementyev in MIT,in which they developed a self-designed wrist-worn device with dust sensor,and a G-sensor(temperature and accelerometer),they got pretty accurate result.In their report they also mentioned a previous study (study [1])in which the researchers used an wrist-worn device to analyze smoking behaviors with data from accelerometer,and they got an accuracy of about 70%.Our study was inspired by their work, we implemented an audio-signal based algorithm and integrated it with accelerometer to achieve our goal.

Methods
Subjects and measurements
Due to the limited finance and time,we only test this on our team members:Ye Tian and me.we have tested this in both experimental situation and outside environment.
Device
Android smart phone with  SDK-19 android system.
